# Stormworks Scripts

Why not get the scripts into version control? These scripts control behaviors of my player-designed vehicles in [Stormworks](https://store.steampowered.com/app/573090/Stormworks_Build_and_Rescue/).

The best way to edit these is via the online IDE: <https://lua.flaffipony.rocks/>

## Constraints

In-game Lua scripts are limited to 4096 bytes. Minification can be handy.
